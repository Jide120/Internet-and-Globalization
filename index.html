            <p class="text"> The Internet facilitates information flows, trade, and direct access to global markets. Since its beginnings in the 1960s, the Internet has evolved into a global network that affects national borders and international borders, as well as state and local jurisdictions. As a consequence of its transaction and communication advantages, the Internet has become an efficient and effective conduit for global trade and international market expansion.</p>
            <p class="text">However, the rise of the Internet also creates the potential for national bodies to exclude certain actors from a market interface that is assumed to be beneficial to all. It also presents new risks of security and privacy. How do we begin to monitor and regulate a rapidly growing and key component of modern day globalization? Is regulation even necessary? </p>
